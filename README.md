# Yet another Crypto-PAn implementation for Python

## Overview

Fork of the CryptoPAn python implementation of the prefix preserving scheme for IP addresses presented in the paper referenced below.
In this fork I have added code to simulate an attack on the python implementation.
Addresses are stored in a binary tree and the tree is updated when the attacker ask for the decryption of an IP.
